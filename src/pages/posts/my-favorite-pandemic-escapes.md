Right now we are in the middle of a global pandemic. Pandemics have happened in the past but never on such a large scale. Our world is in the middle of something unprecedented right now. There is so much uncertainty and so many questions.  How many more people will be sick? What comes after all of this isolation? Is this sort of event going to be rare or frequent in the future? Are we just at the beginning of the economic issues we will face caused by all of this?

While sitting at home pondering all of these questions I began searching for stimulation to replace all of the time I usually spent commuting and seeing friends and family. I found new hobbies. It wasn’t until I had a few projects under way that I started to realize my intent of these hobbies was more than to just fill time. They were fulfilling another need I am increasingly aware of. A need for some sort of control over my world and my life.

I realized that I had begun creating my own small worlds.  Worlds that I can control. While these worlds don’t change the world that I live in, they do help me cope with all of the uncertainty in the real world. And all of the anxiety that uncertainty can create.

A few weeks ago I ordered a Lego set. Why not? I was bored and my fiancé was putting together puzzles so this was going to be my puzzle to stave off the boredom. When it came I sat at my desk and unpacked everything. I had purchased a kit that was inspired by Nasa’s Lunar Gateway. It consists of a small ship with a station for living space for several Lego astronauts. This small little encapsulated world grew under my fingers in a couple of hours. It may sounds silly. I hadn’t played with Legos since I was a child, but I got so much satisfaction from building the little living space for my miniature astronauts. The few hours this took were relaxing and immediately after,  I started looking for more world building

I don’t now know how I came across the idea of building a terrarium, but that became my next project. This project was much more elaborate. Using stones, I created a drainage system at the bottom of a glass container. I then covered the stones with mesh and nutrient rich soil complete with worms.  I had created  a small bio dome of sorts. Modeling it after a tropical environment, I filled it with ferns, Moses, and other tropical plants. It sits on my desk and throughout the days I’ve started noticing weather patterns in the little bubble. In the morning the glass beads up with condensation and by the late afternoon the water has fallen and covered the leaves of the plants. I continue to poke around moving soil, trimming plants, rearranging rocks, and adding plants.

Building these small little worlds has been hugely satisfying. While the control I feel is just an illusion, it’s proved to be a useful one in an unpredictable, ever changing world around me.
