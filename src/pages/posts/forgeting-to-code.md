So often I start a writing project by deciding that I need an environment to write in. So how do I resolve that? I build a site of course! From scratch. I spend a few days tinkering with fonts and colors. I spend a few hours with configuration (setting up my repo, domain, deploys, etc.) And then after about a week of coding out a site, I abandon my writing project. It's just too much work!

Tonight I decided to forget that I know how to code. I think coding is my way of distracting myself from the real challengeâ€”I don't know what to write about. Or how to write very well.
