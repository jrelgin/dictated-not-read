I'm Jason Elgin, a Senior UX Engineer from [Atlanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta), Georgia. I love to backpack anytime I get the chance. I'm also a huge fan of speculative fiction in any formâ€”books, movies, games, anything.

I live with my wonderful girlfriend Rachel our dog, Monty and our cat, Charly. Below is a very rare moment of them getting along.
