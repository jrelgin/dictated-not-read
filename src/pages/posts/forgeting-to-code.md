So often I start a writing project by deciding that I need an environment to write in. So how do I resolve that? I build a site of course! From scratch. This might be a good time to mention I am a web developer and designer by trade. So, I spend a few days tinkering with fonts and colors. I spend a few hours with configuration (setting up my repo, domain, deploys, etc.) And then after about a week of coding out a site, I abandon my writing project. It's just too much work!

Tonight I decided to forget that I know how to code. Coding is my way of distracting myself from the real challengeâ€”I don't know what to write about. Or how to write very well. So instead of spending days designing and tooling a place to put words, I just threw something together and started writing those words I'm always hiding from.

## Writing as therapy

In my early 20s I had terrible anxiety. I still do, but back then I had no idea how to cope with it. I was just learning what anxiety was and that I struggled with it. In a moment of intense anxiety while sitting in a college class I started writing in a spiral bound notebook while the professor was lecturing, hoping it looked like I was taking notes. I wasn't trying to write anything in particular. I was just trying to distract myself. And it turned out that it worked really well. It was like I was transferring my thoughts out of my head and on to a piece of paper. That concept was really novel for me at the time although thinking about it now, I guess that's what writing is. After this discovery I kept a journal for years. Sometimes I wrote about my day. Sometimes I just dumped my brain out on paper to feel better. It was such a wonderful discovery. 

## Writing to think

In my early 30s I stumbled upon an audio book called [_Accidental Genius_](https://www.audible.com/pd/Accidental-Genius-Audiobook/B004BB940G "Accidental Genius audiobook") by Mark Levy. The title seems full of hubris, but it must have been the subtitle, _Using Writing to Generate Your Best Ideas, Insight and Content_ that made me pick it up. In it Levy describes something he calls freewriting. He suggests 10 to 15 minute writing exercises that are basically a stream of conscious exercise. He encourages readers to not stop moving the pen (or the fingers on the keyboard) and write anything that comes to mind gently steering the writing toward any subject you like. If you get lost, that's ok. Just keep typing something. It strikes me as being very similar to meditation in that way. You are just gently nudging focus, but not pressuring yourself about it. I found that book nearly a decade ago and I still use this technique when I get stuck on almost any sort of problem. 

## Writing publicly 

I've never really written for quality, but I've always wanted to. When I was younger I would romanticized writing prose that would impress the world. But I've always written to get things out of my head whether it be problems or ideas. My hope is that writing publicly will force me to pay attention to my form a little bit more. I hope that over time my writing improves. I no longer have dreams of being a famous author. I have new dreams. But I do want to improve my communication skills, find my writing voice, and share things that I learn with people along the way. We'll see what happens! Maybe the fact that I didn't hide behind code for a week this time means something.
